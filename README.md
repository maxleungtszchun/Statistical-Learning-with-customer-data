# Machine/Statistical Learning with data generated from customerAnalytics

Both [Neural Network model](https://github.com/maxleungtszchun/Statistical-Learning-with-customer-data/blob/main/neural_network.ipynb) and [Logistic Regression model](https://github.com/maxleungtszchun/Statistical-Learning-with-customer-data/blob/main/logistic_reg.ipynb) can predict customer "come back" behavior with around 70% accuracy by using only 3 variables/features (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) generated from the R package [customerAnalytics](https://github.com/maxleungtszchun/customerAnalytics). With more detailed customer demographic data, the accuracy is expected to be improved.
